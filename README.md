# 📝 Quill to DOCX Export in React (Vite)

This project demonstrates how to use **Quill** (via a CDN) in a **Vite + React** app to create and export rich-text content as a DOCX file using `quill-to-word`.  

🔗 **Live Demo & Editable Code:**

- Initializes Quill inside a **React functional component**.
- Converts the **Quill Delta format to a DOCX file**.
